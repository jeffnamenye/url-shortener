To install follow link to my git repo and click the green clone or download
button to install on your PC

If you don't already have them installed you will need **Node and NPM** you can do that through brew or through their web sites [Node.js(https://nodejs.org/en/)and NPM((https://www.npmjs.com))]

In your command line change your directory to **UrlShortener** and then **brew install npm**  this should install all dependencies in the **package.json** file into your directory.

Still in your command line type and still in your directory UrlShortener type
**node src/server** it should say 'Good to go on port 300'.üëç

"http://hoitytoity.comlTSLj5o" in your results box about middle of the page.
